        Unlike the test test_nested-multiples-with-internal-boundary, this
        piece of text not only contains the outer boundary tags 
        ------- =_aaaaaaaaaa1 
        and 
        ------- =_aaaaaaaaaa0 
        but puts them at the start of a line! And, to be even nastier, it
        even includes a couple of end tags, such as this one:
        
        ------- =_aaaaaaaaaa1--
        
        and this one, which is from a multipart we haven't even seen yet!
        
        ------- =_aaaaaaaaaa4--
        
        This will, I'm sure, cause much breakage of MIME parsers. But, as 
        far as I can tell, it's perfectly legal. I have not yet ever seen
        a case of this in the wild, but I've seen *similar* things.
